# ProjectYozora
Yozora is a modular, feature packed discord bot. This monorepo contains all the different bots.

This project is still in it's very early stages and is unusable to the average user.
Feel free to contribute ideas, voice concerns or similar in the issues. 

Before working on a pull request that adds big features or does big changes to existing features, please open an issue beforehand to discuss proposed changes.
I would really not like having to turn down your work because it doesn't fit my ideas for this project.
